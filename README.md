# covid_detection_from_xray
This repository is a part of youtube session Web-ML portal conducted by DSC NIT Surat.
This repository contains my base work for covid detection through x-ray.

The task is to detect whether pneunomonia or covid-19 is present from x-ray images or patient is completely normal.
### Important datasets link

From the first link I collected x-ray images containing covid-19, the information about labels are extracted from metadata.csv and images are in images folder.<br>
From the second link I collected x-ray images containing pneunomonia and normal x-ray images.
